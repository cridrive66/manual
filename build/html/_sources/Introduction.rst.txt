Introduction
============

The *APRIORA* plugin is a QGIS tool divided in two groups:

* Flow Estimation
* API Emission

The first set of tools is designed to estimate flow in normal and low condition in a catchment, while the
second one calculate concentration of different Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and perform the 
risk assessment in each river section.
